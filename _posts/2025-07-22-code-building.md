Below is a sample post demonstrating how to upload and display code lines in your GitHub blog using Markdown.

Let's work on it!

### 01. Hello World in Python

```python
# "python" is the language you want to use
print("Hello, World!")




# this "wave thingy" lmao
```

This is the most basic Python command. It prints a string to the console.

### 02. Variables and Data Types in Python

```python
name = "Wheevu"
age = 22
is_student = True
is_crazy = False

print(f"My name is {name}, I am {age} years old. I would like to say I ain't freaking crazy, but some would say otherwise.")
```

In this example:

- `name` is a string
- `age` is an integer
- `is_student` is a boolean

We also use **f-string formatting** to print variables inside a string.
