This document outlines the project proposal for an AI model designed to classify film genres based on their poster images.

## 1. Project Introduction

This project is proposed by **Group 02 (Squid Game)**.

#### Team Members:
*   Josh (Vũ) – Team Leader
*   Sam (Sơn)
*   Peter (Phước)
*   Kelly (Khuê)

## 2. Project Details

### 2-1. Project Title & Summary
*   **Title:** AI Model to Classify Film Genres Based on Poster Image
*   **Summary:** We will develop a machine learning model to classify film genres into one of five categories (Action, Horror, Animated, Romance, and Sci-Fi) using only the movie's poster image as input.

### 2-2. Project Goals
This project aims to create a robust model capable of classifying poster images for the five specified film genres. The core tasks involve:
1.  Collecting a diverse and well-labeled dataset of movie posters.
2.  Preprocessing and augmenting the image data for optimal training.
3.  Building, training, and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) to achieve the classification goal.

### 2-3. Expected Outcome
The primary outcome will be a trained and saved model file that can accurately predict a movie's genre when given a poster image. This model could be integrated into a simple application or API for practical use.

## 3. Technical Demonstration

To illustrate a part of the potential workflow, here is a simple Python code snippet demonstrating how a prediction function might be structured. This example uses placeholder logic for the actual model prediction.

### Sample Python Code

```python
import numpy as np
# In a real project, you would use libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and Pillow
# from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
# from PIL import Image

def classify_poster(image_path):
    """
    A sample function to simulate loading a poster image and
    predicting its genre.
    """
    print(f"Processing image from: {image_path}...")
    
    # --- Step 1: Load and preprocess the image (mocked) ---
    # img = Image.open(image_path).resize((256, 256))
    # img_array = np.array(img) / 255.0
    # img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0) # Add batch dimension
    print("Image loaded and preprocessed successfully.")

    # --- Step 2: Load a pre-trained model (mocked) ---
    # model = load_model('film_genre_classifier.h5')
    print("AI model loaded.")

    # --- Step 3: Make a prediction (mocked) ---
    # prediction = model.predict(img_array)
    # For this demo, we'll just return a random genre.
    genres = ['Action', 'Horror', 'Animated', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']
    predicted_genre = np.random.choice(genres)
    
    print("Prediction complete!")
    return predicted_genre

# --- Example Usage ---
poster_file = 'example_poster.jpg'
genre = classify_poster(poster_file)

print(f"\n---> The predicted genre for '{poster_file}' is: {genre}")
